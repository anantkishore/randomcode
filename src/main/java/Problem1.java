public class Problem1 {

    /*

    Problem Statement: Implement a RESTful microservice using Spring Boot that provides an API endpoint to calculate the factorial of a given number.

Requirements:

The API should accept a positive integer as input and return the factorial of that number.
Handle invalid input gracefully and return appropriate error responses.
Use proper error handling and validation techniques.
Ensure the microservice is properly structured, adhering to the principles of good software design and microservices architecture.
Implement any necessary unit tests to validate the functionality of the microservice.

Evaluation Criteria:

Correctness: The microservice should accurately calculate the factorial of a given number.
Code Quality: Assess the code's readability, maintainability, and adherence to best practices.
Error Handling: Evaluate how well errors and edge cases are handled.
Spring Boot and Microservices Best Practices: Assess the proper usage of Spring Boot and microservices principles, such as separation of concerns and modularity.

During the live coding test, the candidate would be provided with a coding environment or IDE and would be required to implement the RESTful microservice based on the given problem statement and requirements. They should demonstrate their ability to use Spring Boot and Microservices concepts effectively while implementing the factorial calculation logic and exposing it through an API endpoint.

Throughout the coding session, the interviewer can observe the candidate's problem-solving approach, coding style, error handling techniques, knowledge of Spring Boot, and adherence to microservices principles. The candidate can also explain their thought process, design choices, and justify the use of certain Spring Boot or Microservices features.

After completing the implementation, the candidate can present and explain their solution to the interviewer, highlighting the key design decisions and discussing the reasoning behind their code structure.

The evaluation would be based on the criteria mentioned above, considering the correctness, code quality, error handling, and proper usage of Spring Boot and Microservices principles in the candidate's solution.
