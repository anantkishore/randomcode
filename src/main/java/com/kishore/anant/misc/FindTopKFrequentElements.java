We are given an unsorted array containing numbers taken from the range 1 to ‘n’. The array can have duplicates, which means some numbers will be missing. Find all those missing numbers.

Example 1:

Input: [2, 3, 1, 8, 2, 3, 5, 1]
Output: 4, 6, 7
Explanation: The array should have all numbers from 1 to 8, due to duplicates 4, 6, and 7 are missing.

Find the maximum value in a given Bitonic array. An array is considered bitonic if it is monotonically increasing and then monotonically decreasing. Monotonically increasing or decreasing means that for any index i in the array arr[i] != arr[i+1].

Example 1:

Input: [1, 3, 8, 12, 4, 2]
Output: 12
Explanation: The maximum number in the input bitonic array is '12'.
